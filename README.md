# Fusion 360 Equation Curve

One of the missing features of fusion 360 is the ability to generate curves according to arbitrary mathematical expressions. This script adds that functionality. Unfortunately I don't see a way to add this functionality in a way such that the equation can be changed after the fact like native fusion features.

# Installation

Running `make` in the project directory should copy the script into the correct folder on a mac. On other OSes you need to manually copy it into the corresponding folder. Additionally copy the libraries described in requirements to the same folder.
